# Cognitive Constellations 🧠✨

Interactive visualization comparing how human cognition and AI neural networks process information differently.



## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Scenarios**: 4 real-world scenarios (Creative Problem Solving, Face Recognition, Urgent Decisions, Learning Skills)
- **Animated Flow**: Watch information flow through cognitive processes in real-time
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare human and AI processing simultaneously
- **Research-Based**: Built on cognitive psychology and neuroscience research
- **Custom Scenarios**: Framework for creating your own scenarios

## 🎯 Concept

This project literally visualizes the metaphor "connecting the dots" by showing:
- **Human minds**: Dynamic, parallel, emotion-influenced networks with flexible pathways
- **AI networks**: Sequential, deterministic, layer-by-layer processing

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Select a scenario (e.g., "Creative Problem Solving")
2. Choose Single View or Side-by-Side mode
3. Hit Play and watch the animation
4. See how human cognition jumps between processes while AI follows a linear path

## 💡 Key Differences Visualized

| Human Cognition | AI Networks |
|----------------|-------------|
| Parallel processing | Sequential layers |
| Intuition & creativity | Statistical patterns |
| Flexible pathways | Fixed architecture |
| Emotion-influenced | Mathematical only |

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Based on cognitive science covering:
- Perception, Attention, Working Memory, Long-term Memory
- Intuition, Creativity, Logical Reasoning, Decision Making

## 🛠️ Technologies

- React
- Lucide React (icons)
- SVG animations
- Tailwind CSS

## 📖 Usage

This is a React component that can be integrated into any React application. See the demo or clone this repo to explore the code.
